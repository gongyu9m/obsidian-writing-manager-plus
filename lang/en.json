It's especially recommended for:\n\n-   **Novelists**: For managing complex plots with multiple chapters and scenes.\n-   **Screenwriters**: For structuring and rearranging stories scene by scene.\n-   **Academic & Report Writers**: For drafting multiple sections and integrating them into a final document."

          "content": "### 1. Set Your Base Project Folder\n\nThe first thing to do is specify the workspace for the plugin. Go to **Settings > Default** and select your **`Base Project Folder`**. This is where you'll gather all your writing projects, like novels and screenplays. This folder becomes the root of the plugin's view.\n\n### 2. Open the Plugin View\n\nClick the **'Open Writing Manager +'** icon (a notebook) in the left ribbon menu to open the view. Now you'll see your project folders on the left and the content of the selected folder on the right.\n\n### 3. Select a Project and Add Entries\n\nClick on a project folder in the left pane. Now, add entries (markdown notes) to that folder using Obsidian's file explorer. You'll see them appear in real-time in the right pane."

          "content": "### Project\n\nIn this plugin, a 'Project' is simply a **folder**. The 'Folder Tree' in the left pane shows the subfolder structure of your designated `Base Project Folder`.\n\n### Entry\n\nAn 'Entry' is a single **markdown note** (.md file). It's the smallest building block of your writing, managed as a list in the right pane.\n\n### Folder Representative Note\n\nA **special note** for recording a folder's synopsis or settings. Its content is displayed at the top of the right pane, helping you quickly grasp the project's overview. It is automatically excluded from compilation.\n\n### Status\n\nA visual marker indicating the **progress** of each entry. You can freely create statuses like 'Idea', 'Writing', or 'Done' and assign colors to see your work's progress at a glance.\n\n### Metadata and Tagline\n\n**Additional information** recorded in a note's frontmatter. You can display this in the view to quickly check key details of each entry. A field designated as a **'Tagline'** is always displayed below the title, acting like a subtitle.\n\n### Compilation\n\nA feature that **merges multiple entries** (notes) into a single, complete markdown file according to a set order. This allows you to easily turn a complex project into a single manuscript."

This order is saved within their parent folder.\n\n### Working with Entries\n\n-   **Change status and filter**: Use the dropdown menu on the right of each entry to change its status. Use the filter bar at the top of the list to view only entries with a specific status or to search by name.\n-   **Inline metadata editing**: Click on a metadata value to edit it directly in place without opening the note. Typing `[[` will activate link autocompletion.\n-   **Reorder entries**: Drag the handle to the left of each entry to easily change the compilation order. This order is saved per folder.\n\n### Finalizing Your Manuscript: Compilation\n\nPress the **Compile button** (the `combine` icon) in the top-right corner to start compilation. Only entries with the 'Completion Status' (defined in Settings > Compilation) will be merged in order to create a single file."

Press `Add new field` to enter a desired field name. Click the `pin icon` next to a field to set it as a **'Tagline'**, which functions like an always-visible subtitle.\n\n### Status Settings\n\nCreate your own work statuses by clicking `Add new status`. Freely assign names and colors to each status to visually manage your workflow.\n\n### Compilation Settings\n\n-   **`Include files from subfolders`**: When enabled, includes files from all subfolders of the current project in the compilation.\n-   **`Completion Status`**: Select the status that identifies entries ready for compilation.\n-   **`Default compilation path`**: Specifies where compiled files will be saved. You can also set it to 'Ask every time'.\n\n### Add-on Settings\n\nEnable the **`Folder Representative Note`** feature and set the filename rule (e.g., `{{folder_name}}.md`) to identify these notes."

          "content": "### Use with the `Folder Notes` plugin\n\nThe 'Folder Representative Note' feature in this plugin works seamlessly with the popular `Folder Notes` plugin. For best compatibility, set the 'Folder Representative Note filename' in **Add-on Settings** to `{{folder_name}}.md`.\n\n### Separate Projects with Folders\n\nIf you want to completely separate workspaces, you can manage multiple projects individually by changing the **`Base Project Folder`** in the settings. Even if you change the folder, the sorting order information for entries and subfolders in the original folder is safely preserved, so you can always return to your previous work."
